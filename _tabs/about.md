Hello. My name is Sun Woong Chang and I'm residing in South Korea. I graduated from Handong Global Univerity with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and am currently enrolling in a Web programming course provided by an educational facility called SSAFY (Samsung Software Academy For Youth). I learned both Front-end and Back-end here, and wish to become a Full-stack developer, with a slight inclination on Back-end. 

Thanks for visiting my humble blog and I hope you can find what you came here for!
