It took me some time in order to return to this topic. Not only because I was organizing the steps I took into a presentable format. I did say that I would immediately return to the topic, but alas, t'was a time of transition--a period of wrapping up the former project and initiating a new one--and with the influx of workload piling in front of me, I couldn't return to the topic that I was planning on finishing last post. Nonetheless, here I am, and now, I would like to talk about SSL certificates and how to apply them to our project.
