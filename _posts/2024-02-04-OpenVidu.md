Last post, I talked about what WebRTC is and what STUN and TURN are in general. I want to continue with the flow and move on to talk about the specificalities of them, and also, their contemporary, open-source implementation called OpenVidu. I wish to also talk about the problems and the troubleshooting process I experienced while trying to make it work in my project.
